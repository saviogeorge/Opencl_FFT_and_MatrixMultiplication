# Opencl_FFT_and_MatrixMultiplication
Project: Opencl For Computationally Intensive Applications In Radar Signal Processing On Intel Processors

The intention of this project is to prepare Intel processor based systems capable to run applications 
using the OpenCL framework on a Linux platform. A basic study of the performance capabilities which 
could be achieved by making use of potential parallelism through the OpenCL framework on Intel integrated 
GPU and multi core CPU is also a part of this work. OpenCL implementations of Fast Fourier Transform, and matrix multiplication 
provided by open source Libraries are made use for this purpose

FFT using the clFFT and Matrix Multiplication using clBLAS libraries.

We have 2 python scripts one to drive the application and give the necessary test inputs
and the results obtained are stored.

The next script makes use of the stored results to generate graphs.

The details of the project are in the report.
